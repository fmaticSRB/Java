# Tutor

This program simulates a student talking to a tutor. 
The student asks questions of the tutor, which the tutor
will answer. For simplicity, there are not many questions
the tutor can be asked. 

When running, run the Student.java file, not the Tutor.java file. 
Student.java will call the Tutor.java file.
