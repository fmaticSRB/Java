# BankAccount_2
This program simulates the user accessing their bank account. 
Unlike BankAccount_1, this program has only one account and 
one type of account (removed checkings, savings, etc). 

However, this program utilizes multiple objects. This is done
in order to display how to utlize multiple objects and how
to access them.
