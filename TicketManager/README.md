#  ASU Partnership. 
In a partnership with Arizona State University, a program was created
that functions very similar to this one. This is the code off which 
that program is based. Due to Copyright reasons, the full code that 
I created for ASU is not able to be displayed. However, I am 
displaying (and have permission to do so) this code as an example in
showing the foundation for that final program.
